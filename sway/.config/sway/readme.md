# Sway config

Because different computers require different input and output configuration,
they are excluded from this workspace. For instance, my personal Framework 13
computer has a 13 inch 4k display, so it requires UI scaling, but my work
ThinkPad does not require UI scaling. Likewise, the ThinkPad has a trackpoint,
but the framework doesn't.

* `input` blocks should go in `config.d/input`.
* `output` blocks should go in `config.d/output`.
